# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- eMMC-enabled kernel for the non-"lite" version of the Compute Module 4. This is a separate specially-built kernel that you must manually opt into; there is currently no way to automatically detect "lite" versus "non-lite" CM4s.
  * To use this kernel, you must manually rename `kernel8-rpi4-emmc.img` to `kernel8-rpi4.img` (replacing the default Pi 4/CM4 "Lite" compatible kernel).

### Changed

- Update to libmt32emu v2.7.0.
- Update to FluidSynth v2.3.0.
- Update to inih r56.
- Updater: `config.txt` is now replaced on update, however the `avoid_warnings` setting is preserved (the only setting that matters to most users).
- Updater: improved error handling.

### Fixed

- Incorrect I²C clock speed with recent Raspberry Pi firmware versions (issue #292). This was caused by core clock frequency scaling by the GPU firmware. Changes to `config.txt` have been added to ensure the I²C clock is stable by locking the core frequency to 250MHz. The newer Raspberry Pi firmware has been restored.
- Some USB MIDI controllers which make use of interrupt endpoints [would not be usable](https://github.com/rsta2/circle/issues/316) (e.g. some Novation models).

## [0.12.1] - 2022-06-14

### Fixed

- I²C communications failure on MiSTer introduced with newer Raspberry Pi firmware. The previous firmware version has been restored until this is resolved.

## [0.12.0] - 2022-06-13

### Added

- Support for SSD1305 displays via a temporary hack (assume SSD1305 when `width` is set to 132). Further details in the wiki.
- Support for WM8960 DACs (e.g. Waveshare WM8960 Audio HAT).

### Changed

- Update to circle-stdlib v15.13/Circle Step 44.5.
- Update to libmt32emu v2.6.3.
- Update to FluidSynth v2.2.7.
- The `i2c_dac_address` and `i2c_dac_init` configuration options have been deprecated and have no longer have any effect. DACs requiring initialization are now automatically detected.
- The `[fluidsynth.soundfont.x]` sections have now been deprecated. SoundFont effects profiles must now be stored in separate .cfg files, with the same file name as the SoundFont (minus extension). This means that file index no longer influences SoundFont settings. See `soundfonts/GeneralUser GS v1.511.cfg` for an example.
- The maximum number of SoundFonts has been increased to 512.
- Updater: deprecated options are now removed when merging configs.
- Installer: missing tools (e.g. `dialog`, `jq`) are now reported if they are missing from the system.

### Fixed

- HDMI audio channels were reversed.
- USB MIDI device stability improvements.

## [0.11.3] - 2022-04-13

### Changed

- Update to inih r55.

### Fixed

- Ethernet connectivity was broken on some Raspberry Pi models. Thanks to Sal Bugliarisi, retro and MorkMikael for the reports!
- Network disconnection/reconnection notifications were broken.

## [0.11.2] - 2022-03-25

### Added

- Support for network MIDI via raw UDP socket (new configuration file option). This is compatible with [MiSTer MidiLink](https://github.com/bbond007/MiSTer_MidiLink).
- New Bash/Python scripts for making the installation/update process easier, especially on MiSTer FPGA (see the [scripts directory](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi/tree/master/scripts) for download/information).

### Changed

- Update to circle-stdlib v15.12/Circle Step 44.4.1.
- Update to FluidSynth v2.2.6.
- Update to inih r54.

## [0.11.1] - 2022-03-10

### Added

- Implemented RNFR/RNTO (file/directory renaming) in the FTP server.
- Support for SSD1312 OLED displays via new horizontal mirroring configuration file option - thanks @nikitalita!

### Changed

- Update to libmt32emu v2.6.1.
  * This update adds support for MT-32 ROM versions 2.06, 2.07 and CM-32LN ROM version 1.00 (CM-32LN is untested).
- Update to FluidSynth v2.2.5.
- MT-32 LCD emulation replaced with new libmt32emu v2.6+ display emulation.
- FluidSynth's master volume gain is now an effects profile setting and can be overridden on a per-SoundFont basis (issue #248). Thanks to @c0d3h4x0r for the suggestion!

### Fixed

- A bug in the config file reader (unterminated string) could cause the last entry in the file to be read as a corrupted value if the file ended without a newline.
- Some FTP commands could work without being logged in.
- Some DAC accessories which make use of a hardware "mute" pin (e.g. Adafruit I²S Audio Bonnet) could be held in a muted state due to a conflict with the Blokas Pisound driver's probing routine (issue #233). The driver now resets these GPIO pins to the initial power-on state, which should fix this issue. Thanks to @htamas2 for the report!
- Sudden loud noise caused by switching SoundFonts whilst receiving MIDI data (issue #247). Any note-on messages received whilst busy switching SoundFonts are now discarded. Thanks to @c0d3h4x0r for the report!

## [0.11.0] - 2021-12-12

### Added

- Support for the new Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
  * You **must** update `config.txt`, otherwise the Zero 2 W will boot the 32-bit Raspberry Pi 2 kernel, which will result in lower performance.
  * This model requires new boot firmware and Wi-Fi firmware - make sure you update `bootcode.bin`, `fixup*.dat`, `start*.elf`, and the contents of the `firmware` directory.
  * PWM audio is available on GPIO pins 12/13 for this model.
- Experimental embedded FTP server for performing updates/config changes without replacing the SD card (new configuration file options).
  * This FTP server is a very basic implementation which DOES NOT feature any kind of transport layer security/encryption. Therefore, you should NOT enable this feature on a public network or expose the Raspberry Pi to the Internet.
  * The FTP server is disabled by default.
- Support for Yamaha MU-series SysEx text messages, and bitmap messages when using a graphical display.

### Changed

- Update to circle-stdlib v15.10/Circle Step 44.3.
- Update ARM toolchains to 10.3-2021.07.
- Update to libmt32emu v2.5.3.
- Update to FluidSynth v2.2.4.
- The default FluidSynth polyphony value has been reduced from 256 to 200 to account for the lower out-of-the-box performance of the Pi Zero 2 W.
  * For the vast majority of use cases, this will have no noticable difference.
  * If you prefer, a +200MHz overclock can be applied to the Zero 2 W match the performance of the Raspberry Pi 3B (1.2GHz), in which case you can use the original higher polyphony value of 256. Commented-out example of how to do this is now provided in `config.txt`.
  * Heatsink/cooling recommended to ensure stability if you decide to do the above.

### Fixed

- "WiFi disconnected!" would be shown on the LCD when Ethernet was disconnected.
- The SoundFont loading "spinner" was broken since v0.10.0.

## [0.10.3] - 2021-09-03

### Fixed

- Broken UART error handling since v0.10.2 which would result in erratic, false MIDI activity under some circumstances. Many thanks to WiteWulf and Alex Mitchell for the report!

## [0.10.2] - 2021-08-11

### Added

- Ability to swap the MT-32 stereo channels in order to work around bugs in games that are not aware of the MT-32's reversed panpot value interpretation (new configuration file option and custom SysEx message).

### Changed

- MIDI and UART related warnings are now hidden unless verbose mode is enabled in the configuration file. This is a preventative measure against false bug reports stemming from buggy games/user equipment, and to improve aesthetics (real synthesizers tend to silently ignore harmless stray MIDI bytes).

### Fixed

- Guru Meditation that could occur if non-default mt32emu options were specified but the synth was unavailable due to missing ROMs.

## [0.10.1] - 2021-08-01

### Changed

- Update to libmt32emu v2.5.2.
- Update to FluidSynth v2.2.2.
- The default value for `usb_serial_baud_rate` is now 38400 to reflect the most common use case (connecting to a vintage PC with SoftMPU).

### Fixed

- The MIDI level meters could get stuck under certain circumstances (issue #142).
- Sending a MIDI reset SysEx would cause the MIDI level meters to instantly zero rather than fall off gradually.
- Sending a Yamaha XG reset SysEx will now reset the MIDI level meters.
- SC-55 text SysEx messages of length <32 were not being displayed.

## [0.10.0] - 2021-06-26

### Added

- Brand new boot splash logo when using graphical displays - many thanks to James Sparkman for the excellent pixel art conversion!
  * You can re-enable verbose startup messages with a new configuration file option.
- Basic networking support (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) - read the new `[network]` section of the configuration file to learn how to enable and set it up.
  * In order to use Wi-Fi, firmware must be copied to the root of the SD card (new `firmware` directory in release package), and SSID/password must be added to `wpa_supplicant.conf` (example file in release package).
- Support for receiving MIDI over the network via Wi-Fi or Ethernet using the RTP-MIDI/AppleMIDI protocol.
  * macOS users can use this feature without any additional software (see [Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/audio-midi-setup/ams1012/mac)).
  * Windows users can use [rtpMIDI by Tobias Erichsen](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/rtpmidi/rtpmidi-tutorial.html).
  * Linux users can use [rtpmidid by David Moreno](https://github.com/davidmoreno/rtpmidid).
- Ability to configure FluidSynth reverb/chorus effects (new configuration file options).
  * Defaults can be set in the `[fluidsynth]` section.
  * Additional sections can be added to create "profiles" that override the defaults for specific SoundFonts.
  * An example section has been added for GeneralUser GS (assumed to be at index 0) as recommended by S. Christian Collins.
- The rotary encoder direction can now be reversed (new configuration file option).
- Ability to use the HDMI port for digital audio (new configuration value for `output_device`). This allows you to use inexpensive HDMI audio extractors or VGA+audio dongles to get better audio quality out of the Raspberry Pi (compared to the headphone jack).
- Additional boot files for the Compute Module 4 and Raspberry Pi 400 are now included.
  * The Raspberry Pi 400 is untested.
- Ability to use USB serial devices for MIDI input (CDC class devices, CH341, CP2102, FT231x, PL2303); a new configuration file option has been added to allow setting the desired baud rate.

### Changed

- Update to circle-stdlib v15.8/Circle Step 44.1.
- Update to libmt32emu v2.5.0.
- Update to FluidSynth v2.2.1.
- Complete overhaul of LCD code.
  * MIDI level meters now account for channel volume and expression properly and are much more responsive.
  * Long text messages (e.g. SoundFont names) are now scrolled, short text messages are now centered.
  * Basic support for smaller 16-character wide screens has been added.
- The activity LED no longer illuminates for System Common or System Real-Time messages.
- Default clock speeds/voltages have been lowered for Pi 4/CM4 in config.txt for reduced energy usage and SoC temperature.
- Reduced energy usage when LCD and MiSTer control interface are both disabled (core suspended).
- "GM Mode On"/"GS Reset" SysEx messages are now handled by new internal FluidSynth code which also changes how MIDI Bank Select messages are interpreted. Additionally, "XG Reset" SysEx messages are now handled.

### Fixed

- USB plug/unplug events now bring mt32-pi out of power saving mode.
- Some USB MIDI devices that violate the USB specification were unusable (discussion #102) - a workaround in the USB driver has been implemented. Thanks to @fabbrimichele for reporting and @rsta2 for the fix!
- Hang on "Init USB" when no USB controller is present (e.g. a Compute Module 4-based system with no external XHCI controller). Huge thanks to Serdaco for donating the CM4 and I/O board for testing!
- Boot failure on the 1GB Raspberry Pi 4/CM4 because of a bug in the memory allocator.
- The MIDI level meters would often miss fast notes (e.g. percussion).

## [0.9.0] - 2021-03-19

### Added

- The number of seconds to wait before a SoundFont begins loading after using the switch button can now be adjusted (new configuration file option).
- MT-32 ROMs and SoundFonts can now be loaded from USB mass storage devices.
  * This feature should be considered **unstable/experimental** - some USB disk/Raspberry Pi combinations can encounter freezes/crashes.
  * SoundFonts will be rescanned and the indices updated if a USB storage device is inserted or removed.
  * USB storage devices must be FAT32 formatted.
  * MT-32 ROMs must be located under a `roms` directory on the root of the device.
  * SoundFonts must be located under a `soundfonts` directory on the root of the device.
  * Only one USB storage device is supported at a time.
  * The SoundFont index continues counting after the last SD card SoundFont index. If there are no SoundFonts on the SD card, the first USB storage SoundFont starts at index zero.
  * Special thanks to @rsta2 for providing important USB driver fixes and mmmonkey Pete for donating a Raspberry Pi 3B for testing!
- Ability to set master volume gain and reverb gain for mt32emu (new configuration file options).

### Changed

- Update to circle-stdlib v15.6/Circle Step 43.3.
- Update to inih r53.
- Update to FluidSynth v2.1.8.
- Update ARM toolchains to 10.2-2020.11.
- Config file options are now case-insensitive.
- The `usb` configuration option has been moved to the `[system]` section. Please update your configuration file if you use this option.

### Fixed

- Large files mistakenly placed in the `roms` directory could cause mt32-pi to crash on startup (issue #93).

### Removed

- Old ROM loading behavior now removed. If you have `MT32_CONTROL.ROM`/`MT32_PCM.ROM` files in the root of your SD card, please move them to the `roms` subdirectory otherwise they will fail to load.
- Unused USB drivers removed (kernel size reduced).
- Unused C standard library functions now removed by linker (kernel size reduced).

## [0.8.5] - 2021-02-10

### Fixed

- 128x32 SSD1306 displays were broken (flickering) since 0.8.4.

## [0.8.4] - 2021-02-07

### Added

- USB plug & play support for MIDI interfaces.
  * You can now connect/disconnect USB MIDI devices at runtime and they will be used instead of the GPIO MIDI interface when present.
- Support for SH1106 OLED displays - many thanks to @arananet for donating a screen!

### Changed

- Update to libmt32emu v2.4.2.
- Update to FluidSynth v2.1.7.
- Rotary encoder now has an acceleration curve applied to it when turned quickly.
- The SoundFont name is now displayed before loading when using a button to cycle through them.

### Fixed

- Some USB MIDI devices were not being detected at startup.
- "LCD-Auto" mode for MiSTer was broken because of a bug in the SSD1306 framebuffer difference-checking code.
- Rapidly-changing panning values [could cause pops/clicks](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/issues/768) in FluidSynth - many thanks to @Asbrandt for reporting and @derselbst for the quick fix!
  * This was particularly noticable in the Descent Level 1 soundtrack's bassline, for example.
  * A temporary patch has been applied until FluidSynth v2.1.8 is released.

## [0.8.3] - 2021-01-16

### Added

- FluidSynth is now reset when a "GM Mode On" or "GS Reset" SysEx message is received.
- FluidSynth is now reconfigured when GS "Use For Rhythm Part" SysEx messages are received for songs that use multiple drum kits.

### Fixed

- Switching MT-32 ROM sets via button press would fail if the next ROM set wasn't present. For example, if an MT-32 "new" set wasn't present, then pressing the button would not switch from "old" to CM-32L as expected.

## [0.8.2] - 2021-01-06

### Changed

- Update to FluidSynth v2.1.6.

### Fixed

- Missing part level bar segments and "glitchy" rendering when using HD44780 LCDs.
- Missing part level bar "bases" when using HD44780 LCDs.
- Backlight would not be turned off/on for supported I²C HD44780 LCDs when entering/exiting power saving mode.

## [0.8.1] - 2021-01-03

### Fixed

- Boot failure on Raspberry Pi 4 due to inability to allocate heap.

## [0.8.0] - 2021-01-03

### Added

- Support for the SSD1309 using the `ssd1306_i2c` driver - many thanks to @flynnsbit for testing!
- Support for the [Blokas Pisound](https://blokas.io/pisound/) - many thanks to @sigkill for providing the device for development!
- Support for configuration using [MiSTer FPGA](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)'s OSD via an I²C control interface in certain cores - many thanks to @sorgelig for collaborating and implementing the MiSTer side!
- Support for physical buttons and rotary encoders with two "simple" control schemes (new configuration file option).
  * `simple_buttons` allows connecting 4 buttons for switching synth, switching MT-32 ROM/SoundFont, decreasing and increasing volume.
  * `simple_encoder` allows connecting 2 buttons and a rotary encoder (with button). Volume is adjusted by turning the encoder, encoder button will be enabled in a future release.
  * Menu system/additional button features will come in future releases; this is just to get basic functionality implemented.
  * Details on how to wire these controls will be made available in the wiki.
- Animated loading "spinner" for when large SoundFonts are being loaded.
  * This will probably be replaced with a progress bar in the future.
- Support for Roland SC-55 "graphics" messages when using a graphical display.
  * A good example of this is the Roland "Star Games" demo MIDI (`STARGAME.MID`).
- Ability to set master volume gain for FluidSynth (new configuration file option).

### Changed

- SD card I/O speed increased by up to ~180% for cards that support High Speed mode (almost all cards available for purchase today).
  * This should dramatically reduce SoundFont loading times.
- MT-32 ROM/SoundFont switch messages are now only shown when the appropriate synth is active.
- A message is now displayed on the LCD for a second just before entering power saving mode.

### Fixed

- Switching MT-32 ROM sets whilst MIDI was playing could cause a crash.
- Switching SoundFonts too often (especially large ones, and especially while MIDI is playing) could result in a crash due to an out-of-memory condition.
  * This has been solved with some upstream fixes by [the FluidSynth team](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/issues/727) combined with a custom memory allocator that should prevent fragmentation. Many thanks to @derselbst and @jjceresa for their help!
- Power saving mode would never be entered whilst in SoundFont mode if the user had switched SoundFonts.

## [0.7.1] - 2020-11-26

### Added

- "Loading" message when switching SoundFonts.

### Changed

- Update to GeneralUser GS v1.511.
  * This is a currently-unpublished version from the author, who has made several important fixes to the SoundFont to improve compatibility with FluidSynth v2.1.0+.
- Update to circle-stdlib v15.5/Circle Step 43.2.
- Part level meters in SoundFont mode now have "bases".

### Fixed

- Incorrect `-dirty` suffix on version string on clean builds (again!).
- Crash when using USB MIDI interface in SoundFont mode, or when resuming from power saving mode.
- Hang on startup if unsupported LCD size is set in configuration file.

## [0.7.0] - 2020-11-22

### Added

- FluidSynth synthesizer engine v2.1.5 for using SoundFonts for General MIDI support and more.
  * You can switch between MT-32 and SoundFont mode at runtime using SysEx.
  * SoundFonts can be switched at runtime using SysEx, with some caveats for large SoundFonts (see FAQ section of README).
  * New configuration file options for changing default synthesizer and SoundFont.
- GeneralUser GS v1.471 included as default SoundFont - many thanks to S. Christian Collins for kindly giving permission!
- Ability to invert the display orientation for SSD1306 (new configuration file option).
- Support for 64 pixel high SSD1306 OLED displays - many thanks to @ctrl_alt_rees for donating a screen!
- Ability to set I2C clock speed (new configuration file option).
  * This is useful for allowing larger displays to refresh at a faster speed; see config file for details.
- Power saving mode with configurable timeout (new configuration file option).
  * The CPU clock speed will be lowered, audio device stopped, and LCD backlight turned off (when possible) after a configurable number of seconds to save energy.
  * Any MIDI activity will instantly bring the system out of power saving mode.
- Undervoltage/throttling detection - `mt32-pi` will now warn the user when the firmware detects an undervoltage/CPU throttling condition.

### Changed

- Update to circle-stdlib v15.4.
- New multi-core architecture; audio rendering and LCD updates moved to their own dedicated CPU cores, leaving MIDI and interrupt processing on the primary core.
- Kernels for Pi 3 and 4 are now compiled for AArch64 (64-bit) for better performance.
  * When upgrading, you **must** replace the `config.txt` file on your SD card and add the new `armstub8-rpi4.bin` file for Pi 4.
  * You should remove old `kernel*.img` files from your SD card.
  * It's recommended that you clear your SD card (except for your `roms` directory) and reconfigure `mt32-pi` for this release.
- Synth engines now compiled with more aggressive optimizations enabled to benefit from ARM NEON instructions.
- Due to the above three changes, it's possible that Raspberry Pi 2 may be more usable with this release, but this is **untested**.
- Kernel size significantly reduced by removing mt32emu ROM loader dependency on C++ iostreams.
- Improved layout of 4-line HD44780 LCD.
  * MT-32 status line moved to bottom row.
  * Part levels now 3 rows high.
- Default sample rate and chunk size reduced to 48000Hz and 256 samples.

### Fixed

- SSD1306 text alignment was off by one pixel.
- SSD1306 part level meters' top pixels would flicker with long sustained notes.
- Part level meters would suddenly snap to a lower level if a quiet note followed a loud note instead of falling off.
- Possibility of overflowing text in HD44780 Print() function.

## [0.6.2] - 2020-10-18

### Fixed

- Update to circle-stdlib v15.3/Circle Step 43.1.
- Update to inih r52.
- Boot speed improved by another ~0.3 seconds when `usb = on` thanks to improvements in Circle Step 43.1.
  * If updating from an old version, make sure you replace `config.txt` to benefit from a couple of other boot optimizations.

### Fixed

- Correct version string is now extracted from ROM 2.04 when switching to it.
- The `none` option for `i2c_dac_init` was broken in v0.6.0.
- Spacing between status row text and part level meters on SSD1306 improved.

## [0.6.0] - 2020-10-04

### Added

- Ability to configure initial MIDI channel assignment (new configuration file option).
- Ability to set custom baud rates for GPIO MIDI (new configuration file option).
  * This could be useful for those wanting to use [SoftMPU](http://bjt42.github.io/softmpu/)'s serial MIDI mode.
- Multiple ROM sets can now be used and switched between using custom SysEx commands. See new `README.md` section and config file for full details.
  * Please move your `MT32_CONTROL.ROM` and `MT32_PCM.ROM` into a new subdirectory called `roms`.
  * For now, the old locations are still checked as a fallback, but this may be removed in a later version.

### Changed

- Update to circle-stdlib v15.2/Circle Step 43.
- Boot speed improved by ~0.5 seconds by using `start_cd.elf`/`start4cd.elf` and `fixup_cd.dat`/`fixup4cd.dat`.
  * If updating from an old version, make sure you replace `config.txt` and add the new `*.elf` and `*.dat` files when updating your SD card to benefit from this.
- LCD/OLED part level meters moved to the upper row(s).
- Config file parsing now more efficient.

### Fixed

- Left/right channels were backwards when using PWM (headphone jack) - thanks @ctrl_alt_rees and YouTube viewers.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-09-19

### Added

- Program change messages are now shown on the LCD.

### Changed

- Activity LED now flashes when other types of messages are received (e.g. SysEx or control changes).

### Fixed

- Complete rewrite of the MIDI parser code.
  * USB and GPIO MIDI streams are now handled by a single code path.
  * Corrupt SysEx messages (e.g. from cheap/no-name MIDI interfaces) will no longer cause `mt32-pi` to hang (issue #25).
  * 2-byte Running Status messages are now handled correctly (issue #26).
- Active Sensing race condition fixed and timeout increased to 330ms as recommended by the MIDI 1.0 Specification.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-09-02
